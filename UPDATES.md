# GMX Development Update

• GMX has unlocked Ethereum Mainnet. Any user on Ethereum can now access GMX’s suite of Perp and Spot markets, along with its high-yield liquidity products. Read the full launch article: https://x.com/GMX_IO/status/2003039870646644773?  

• GMX’s blue-chip liquidity products are now fully cross-chain. The most popular GM and GLV tokens are available to buy on Base, BNB Chain, ETH Mainnet, and Arbitrum, and can now also be stored in your self-custody wallet. Learn more: https://x.com/GMX_IO/status/1999507691555668111 

• Eight new perp markets have been introduced: ZEC, MON, SKY, SYRUP, CHZ, JTO, AR, and DASH.

• The calculation method for the open interest balance has been updated. The new OI calculation is based on the sum of the notional value of positions: https://t.me/GMX_Announcements/1175 

• RPC fallback changes have been introduced, increasing the RPC selection logic reliability for all users 

• GMX’s subgraph indexer APIs have migrated from Satsuma to Goldsky. Subgraph is GMX's legacy indexer API, and it is recommended to use the SQD endpoints: https://docs.gmx.io/docs/api/subsquid/ 

• To keep funding costs reasonable for traders while maintaining attractive conditions for arbitrage funding farmers, GMX is trialling caps on the max paid funding rate. More info: https://t.me/GMX_Announcements/1173 

• Several minor optimizations were implemented to improve the Multichain user experience, the Network selector, and the GMX Account functionality.
